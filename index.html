        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements that are nested within other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element</li>
          <li>The head element contains metadata that helps the browser to render the page correctly</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user</li>
          <li>Header 1 through 6 represent the size given to the text. 1 being largest, 6 being smallest. It's best practice to only use heading 1 a single time per page for user readibility</li>
          <li>the 'ul' tag is used for unordered lists, 'ol' for ordered lists, and 'li' is used for list items within the previous two tags</li>
          <li>Image elements used within the 'image' tag are 'src=""', used to specify the location of the image file, and 'alt=""', which is the description of the appearance or functionality of said image</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are a common way to style a page and are preferred in most cases because you can keep all your CSS rules in a separate file, making it easier to design</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/webd2/student/unit3/images/boxmodel.gif">CSS box model</a></li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the <b>outside</b> of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content <b>inside</b> an element</li>
          <li>When '*' is used as a selector it applies to ALL elements on the page</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma so the declarations affect both selectors</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to said class attribute with a class selector. On this pages CSS the period in '.card' designates it as a class selector </li>
          <li>You can set multiple effects separated by commas to reduce repetitive and inefficient code</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is essentially navigating your files without the use of a GUI</li>
          <li>'ls': used to list all items in current folder</li>
          <li>'md 'FOLDERNAME'': is used to change active folder</li>
          <li>'cd ..': moves back a folder in directory</li>
          <li> 'mkdir 'FOLDERNAME'': creates a new folder within current directory</li>
          <li>'touch 'FILENAME.txt'': creates an empty .txt file with designated name in current directory</li>
          <li> 'start 'FILENAME'': will open the file specified</li>
          <li> 'code .' will open VSC</li>
          <li>'git status': checks what branch you are currently on</li>
          <li>'git checkout -b branch-name': creats a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>'git add -A' will commit all files in the working branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To declare a variable use the var keywoard, after that a name, then an assignment operator (=) to assign the specific data stored in the variable. "var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript";" is 4 items stored under 1 variable</li>
          <li>'console.log()' will output the specified message to the browser console</li>
          <li>'Control Flow' is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JS runs from the first line to the last. ie you cannot make use of variables that haven't been specified</li>
          <li>You can interrupt code flow using conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, if at all</li>
          <li>A value is considered 'falsy' if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, nan, or a boolean data type with the value of 'false'</li>
          <li>All other values, including a boolean with the value of 'true' are considered 'truthy'</li>
          <li>'Truthy' and 'Falsy' are adorable ways to consider data</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. ie: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; the variable 'shapes' accounts for all 4 individual data points</li>
          <li>Numbers and boolean values (true/false) can be used as-is within an array, but strings (names, words, etc.) must be within quotation marks</li>
          <li>Items within an array are numbered starting at 0 and continue sequentially. So an array with 4 items would begin with 0 for the first item and 3 for the final item</li>
          <li>for loops use 3 statements: Declaring a variable and giving it a value, the condition, the statement that allows the for statement to iterate over each item</li>
          <li>x++ is effectively shorthand for x+1</li>
          <li>''.length' is a modifier that counds how many items are in an array. 'shapes.length' would be the length of the shapes array numerically</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It does not execute automatically when the JavaScript file is run, you have to call the function by name to execute it</li>
