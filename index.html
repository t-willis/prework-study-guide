        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements that are nested within other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element</li>
          <li>The head element contains metadata that helps the browser to render the page correctly</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user</li>
          <li>Header 1 through 6 represent the size given to the text. 1 being largest, 6 being smallest. It's best practice to only use heading 1 a single time per page for user readibility</li>
          <li>the 'ul' tag is used for unordered lists, 'ol' for ordered lists, and 'li' is used for list items within the previous two tags</li>
          <li>Image elements used within the 'image' tag are 'src=""', used to specify the location of the image file, and 'alt=""', which is the description of the appearance or functionality of said image</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are a common way to style a page and are preferred in most cases because you can keep all your CSS rules in a separate file, making it easier to design</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/webd2/student/unit3/images/boxmodel.gif">CSS box model</a></li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the <b>outside</b> of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content <b>inside</b> an element</li>
          <li>When '*' is used as a selector it applies to ALL elements on the page</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma so the declarations affect both selectors</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to said class attribute with a class selector. On this pages CSS the period in '.card' designates it as a class selector </li>
          <li>You can set multiple effects separated by commas to reduce repetitive and inefficient code</li>
