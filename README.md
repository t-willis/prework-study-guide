# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- This webpage is designed primarily to hold various notes and study materials pertinent to my upcoming Web Development coding bootcamp.
- Building this project was necessary as it is far more readable, navigable, and searchable than simply using a .txt file or physical notepad.
- Having notes for various subjects in one place, neatly organized, helps streamline the studying process.
- Aside from the obvious benetit of consolidating notes to a single platform, the construction of the webpage gave an introduction to several subjects, most noteably HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
